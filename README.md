## What is Data Surfer?

Data Surfer is an AI sales-intelligence platform that:
- **Discovers companies** that match your ICP
- **Enriches** them with structured, relevant context from the live web
- **Finds key contacts** (decision makers, champions, influencers)
- **Surfaces buying signals** via on-demand checks and optional daily monitoring

## Why Data Surfer?

Most tools blast the same public triggers (title change, funding) at the same time.  
**Data Surfer reads what actually changed** on company sites and across the web — surfacing context-specific signals (new services, tech shifts, expansion hints) so your message lands when prospects are receptive.

---

## Capabilities

- **Company Discovery** — build prospect lists from natural-language searches.
- **Company Enrichment** — extract facts, attributes, and qualifiers from the web.
- **Contact Finding & Enrichment** — identify the right people and fetch verified contact data.
- **Signals (Timing Intelligence)**  
  - **Signals (on-demand):** run one-off signal checks when you need them.  
  - **Daily Signals (monitoring):** automatically re-check targets every day and alert you.
